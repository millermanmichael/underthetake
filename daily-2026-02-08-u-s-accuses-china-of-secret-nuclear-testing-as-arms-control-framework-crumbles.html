        <h1>U.S. Accuses China of Secret Nuclear Testing as Arms Control Framework Crumbles</h1>
        
        <div class="summary">
            The United States has publicly accused China of conducting covert nuclear weapons tests and actively concealing evidence, marking a significant escalation in nuclear tensions between the superpowers. This allegation comes as global nuclear arms control agreements continue to erode, with major powers now operating without the constraints that defined Cold War-era strategic stability.
        </div>
        
        <div class="analysis">
            <p>The U.S. accusation that China is secretly testing nuclear weapons represents more than a bilateral dispute—it signals the complete breakdown of the post-Cold War nuclear order. The Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, though never formally ratified by the U.S. or China, has held as an informal norm for decades. If China is indeed conducting clandestine tests, it suggests Beijing believes it can advance its nuclear capabilities without international consequences, a calculation that fundamentally reshapes strategic deterrence.</p>
            
            <p>The timing is critical. China has been rapidly modernizing and expanding its nuclear arsenal, with Pentagon estimates suggesting it could possess 1,500 warheads by 2035, up from approximately 500 today. Covert testing would allow China to validate new warhead designs for its growing ICBM force without the diplomatic costs of open testing. The U.S. allegation of cover-up activity is particularly concerning—it suggests sophisticated efforts to hide seismic signatures or other telltale signs, indicating premeditation rather than rogue actions.</p>
            
            <p>This accusation also serves U.S. strategic interests. By publicly calling out Chinese testing, Washington may be laying groundwork for its own resumed testing or for walking away from remaining arms control commitments. The Trump administration has already shown willingness to abandon treaties it views as constraining. If China is cheating, the political case for U.S. restraint evaporates. We may be witnessing the opening moves of a three-way nuclear arms race between the U.S., Russia, and China—the first since the 1960s.</p>
            
            <p>The verification challenge is profound. Unlike the Cold War, when the U.S. and USSR developed extensive monitoring capabilities and mutual inspection regimes, no such framework exists with China. Beijing has consistently refused transparency measures that Washington and Moscow eventually accepted. Without trust or verification, accusations become impossible to definitively prove or disprove, creating a paranoia spiral where each side assumes the worst about the other's capabilities and intentions.</p>
            
            <p>The broader geopolitical context matters immensely. This accusation emerges amid U.S.-China tensions over Taiwan, trade, and technology. Nuclear modernization doesn't happen in a vacuum—it reflects deeper strategic competition. If both sides believe conflict is increasingly possible, the incentive to achieve nuclear advantage grows. The absence of meaningful strategic dialogue between Washington and Beijing makes miscalculation more likely, and accusations of cheating further poison the well for future arms control efforts.</p>

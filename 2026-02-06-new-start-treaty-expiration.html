        <h2>The Three Readings</h2>
        <div class="reading hidden-text">
            <div class="reading-title">The Treaty That Never Really Expired</div>
            <div class="reading-body">Notice what happened in the twenty-four hours between the UN's grave warnings and the Axios leak about a deal. Russia says it will 'act responsibly' before anyone asks. The US floats that they're 'closing in' on observance without formal extension. This is theater for domestic audiences who need to see resolve, not compromise. The real message is in what's absent: neither side announced expanded deployments, accelerated production, or withdrawn inspectors. The treaty 'expired' the way a gym membership expires—technically lapsed but both parties still showing up. The performance of expiration lets both avoid the political cost of renewal while maintaining the constraints both actually want. China's refusal to join isn't obstruction; it's the excuse both superpowers needed to keep their bilateral arrangement without admitting they prefer it that way.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="reading absurdity">
            <div class="reading-title">Mutually Assured Politeness After Mutually Assured Destruction</div>
            <div class="reading-body">The world's two largest nuclear arsenals just got unmarried after decades together, and they're handling it like awkward exes who still share a gym membership. Russia preemptively announces it will 'act responsibly'—imagine needing to declare you won't be crazy now that the relationship is over. The US immediately leaks they're 'closing in' on still following the rules anyway. It's the geopolitical equivalent of 'we should see other people' followed by 'but let's still do trivia Tuesday.' NATO stands on the sidelines urging 'restraint' like a concerned friend watching their parents divorce. Meanwhile everyone's begging China to join this dysfunctional family therapy session and China's in the other room with headphones on, correctly reading that this drama isn't really about them. The treaty died but nobody's acting like it, which tells you everything about how much everyone needed to stage its death without actually meaning it.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="reading power-map">
            <div class="reading-title">China Wins By Staying Out of the Room</div>
            <div class="reading-body">China just secured an uncontested decade of nuclear modernization by declining the invitation everyone knew it would decline. The US needed China's refusal to politically justify letting New START lapse without looking reckless. Russia needed it to deflect blame from its 2023 suspension. China understood that joining talks meant accepting constraints on the only nuclear capability still growing. By staying out, China converts a bilateral stalemate into a trilateral advantage. The real shift isn't the treaty expiring—it's the US and Russia discovering they can't compel China into their framework while simultaneously needing to maintain their own limits. The informal extension both sides are floating preserves bilateral predictability while accepting they've lost leverage over Beijing. China gains strategic freedom. The superpowers gain the appearance of control. The verification mechanisms die quietly. Everyone gets what they actually wanted while performing concern about what they're losing.</div>
        </div>
        
        <h2>Historical Parallels</h2>
        <div class="parallel">
            <span class="parallel-event">SALT/START negotiations during Cold War</span> <span class="parallel-year">(1970s-1990s)</span> — Previous periods of US-Russia arms control negotiations alternated between treaties and gaps, with stop-start history of agreements. Eventually led to multiple successful treaties including original START and New START, though with periodic breakdowns.
